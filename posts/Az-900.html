      Hello, and welcome to my blog post! In this post, I want to discuss my recent passing of the AZ-900. In this blog post. I want to go over my background, studying material, and testing experience. Hopefully you will learn something new, or be inspired to start your own learning journey through Microsoft Azure
      <br>
      <br>
      Background: I am currently working IT Support for a low to mid-size company. I mainly deal with Windows and Microsoft products, that is the major factor in me wanting to learn Azure and Microsoft cloud related products. I chose the AZ-900 because it was the beginner certification for Azure and I wanted to move onto some Intermediate certifications like the MD-102 afterward. Before taking the test I was a novice in Azure, and I am still a novice, but I understand the major concepts of the cloud, and now I will need to create some cloud lab environments (more post to come).
      <br>
      <br>
      Study Materials: I mainly used the Microsoft learn, because it goes through each of the exam topics pretty well, nothing on the test that I wasn't expecting. I also watched YouTube videos on topics that I wasn't a hundred percent sure on, like storage, or Azure Arc. After reading, I would create flashcards using Anki, but to be honest I did not use them as much as I should have. My main study practice was the Microsoft learn practice test and Whizlabs quizzes. Everything I mention here will be linked below. I took Multiples test each day a week before the test
      <br>
      <br>
      Test experience: This was my first Microsoft certification and it went well. This test was short overall, it was less than 1:30, and I was certified and in my car. There were different question type that were not shown on the Microsoft Learn practice test. But if you know the material, then you should be fine. No labbing is required for this test, but I would recommend it since it will give you an edge.
      <br>
      <br>  
      Conclusion: I don't think this certification will have a major impact on my career, but this is just a stepping stone, to something bigger. I do recommend that you take this certification if you are interested in Azure, or if you want to get a feel for the Microsoft certification testing experience.
